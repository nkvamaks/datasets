10mer_MGB.xlsx
Number of 10mer DNA oligonucleotides with and without MGB - 3456
Contains 8 groups: 10-20% GC, 20-30% GC, 30-40% GC, 40-50% GC, 50-60% GC, 60-70% GC, 70-80% GC, 80-90% GC
Each group contains equal amount of randomly composed oligos where pairs in positions 0 to 8 starting from 3'-end are fixed in every three oligos. E.g.
AATCAATT*AA* 10%GC
AATGTTAA*AA* 10%GC
ATGTTGTT*AA* 20%GC
TTTCTAAA*AC* 20%GC
TACATATT*AC* 20%GC
AAATTTGA*AC* 20%GC
etc.
Melting temperatures were calculated with Primer Express 3.0 software for 10mer oligonucleotides without and with MGB (minor groove binder).
This melting temperatures are for PCR conditions with buffer containing 40 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2.

siRNA sequences and their normalized inhibitory activities used for training or testing of ANNs; “N” represents ribonucleotides, “n” represents deoxyribonucleotides
Dataset contains of 2431 siRNA sequences and their normalized inhibitory activity
The inhibitory activity is obtained by scaling linearly the averaged raw inhibitory activities such that the positive control becomes 0.900 normalized inhibitory activity and the negative control becomes 0.354 normalized inhibitory activity, latter such to ensure that no negative activity exists.
